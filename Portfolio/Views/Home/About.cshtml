        <h1>about</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Isaiah Young. <br/>
            I write code, engineer, and make art. <br/> But there's a lot more to me than that. <br/>
            <br/>
            The two biggest things in my world are Macky, my best friend and the love of my life, and Juniper, my daughter
            (who will be here Oct. 27th). I live a life full of love because of them and would not trade places with anyone.<br/>
            <br/>
            You probably wouldn't guess it by my major or career choice, but I'm into a lot of liberal arts things. I draw. I play
            guitar, piano, and bass. For six of my formative years I was part of a singing-acting-dancing program in
            which I studied hip-hop, jazz, ballet, and many other forms of dance. I still dance to this day and believe it's
            one of the most freeing forms of expression available to us. <br/> 
            <br/>
            As you could tell by my website, I'm fascinated by the natural world. When I don't have my head in front of
            my computer, it's in the clouds. Although pragmatic in my work, in my personal life I like to spend time asking "why?"
            as opposed to "how?". Most of the books I read are concerned with philosophy, religion, and metaphysics.
            My beliefs about reality align mostly with Zen Buddhism, though I rarely partake in it's practices. <br/>
            <br/>
            I'm a naturally curious person and I spend a considerable amount of time learning new things. This is one of
            the reasons I enjoy programming so much: there's so much to take in and so many different approaches available
            to the same problem. I spend most car rides listening to podcasts by people like Sam Harris, Joe Rogan, and Duncan Trussell.
            I read mostly nonfiction and philosophy, and on YouTube I like watching lectures by Jordan Peterson, Kurzgesagt, and Alan Watts.<br/>
            <br/>
            I'm very extraverted and enjoy going out, attending concerts, and just meeting new people and making new friends.
